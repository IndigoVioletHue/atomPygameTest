# atomPygameTest
Testing Pygame using the Atom IDE, because i can.

Mainly just going to be creating a terrible excuse for a 2D game engine using pygame. I'm sure pygame has a whole host of features to support 
things like this, but i just want to do it anyway. I'll comment my code soon, i promise.

Also, this is my first time using classes. So be gentle.

# Classes
Im hoping to try and make it a flexible engine so i can reuse it as much as i want. But mainly focusing on a platformer genre. This means im gonna be using a lot of generic classs names, such as newMoveable. This is just to keep it open to many things.

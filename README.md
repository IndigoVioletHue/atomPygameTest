# atomPygameTest
Testing Pygame, because i can.

Mainly just going to be creating a terrible excuse for a 2D game engine using pygame. Not for anything other than personal enjoyment, definately not planning any kind of game release. Far too stressful.

Also, this is my first time using classes. So be gentle.

# Classes
Im hoping to try and make it a flexible engine so i can reuse it as much as i want. But mainly focusing on a platformer genre. This means im gonna be using a lot of generic classs names, such as newMoveable. This is just to keep it open to many things.

# atomPygameTest
Testing Pygame using the Atom IDE, because i can.

Mainly just going to be creating a terrible excuse for a 2D game engine using pygame. I'm sure pygame has a whole host of features to support 
things like this, but i just want to do it anyway. I'll comment my code soon, i promise.

Also, this is my first time using classes. So be gentle.
